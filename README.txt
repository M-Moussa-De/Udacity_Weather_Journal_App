- I prefered writing the app-code from scratch on using the starter code.

- Weather Journal App, The second project of the professional-web Track on Udacity platform.
- It's a simple client & server side project.

- Entering the zip code for a certin place, will fecth data from weatheropenmap website.
- The data will be fetched from the API and will be posted on the server, which is build
by Node js and express.
- From within app.js the data will be fetched and displied on the client side.

- Styling is done using Tailwindcss.
- Website is responsive and can be displied on differnt devices.
