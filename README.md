- I preferred writing the app-code from scratch on using the starter code.

- Weather Journal App, The second project of the professional-web Track on Udacity platform.
- It's a simple client & server side project.

- Entering the zip code for a certain place, will fetch data from weatheropenmap website.
- The data will be fetched from the API and will be posted on the server, which is build
by Node JS and express.
- From within app.js the data will be fetched and displayed on the client side.

- Styling is done using Tailwindcss.
- Website is responsive and can be displayed on differnt devices.
